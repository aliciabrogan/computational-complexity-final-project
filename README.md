BSc Mathematics project on Turing machines, P vs NP, and computational complexity — with real-world applications in security and automation.

# Turing Machines and Computational Complexity

This repository contains my BSc Mathematics project completed at the University of Leeds (2021).  
The project investigates the foundations of theoretical computer science, focusing on the mathematical limits of computation.

## Overview

The project explores:

- The role of Turing machines in defining computability
- Complexity classes including P, NP and NP-Complete
- Decision problems and reductions as a method of complexity classification
- Deterministic vs non-deterministic computation
- Real-world relevance in areas such as encryption and online security

The work combines rigorous mathematical proof with practical examples to demonstrate how theoretical concepts inform modern computing.


## Skills Demonstrated

- Mathematical modelling of abstract computation
- Formal proof writing and theoretical analysis
- Understanding of complexity theory and its applications
- Technical writing using LaTeX and BibTeX
- Version control and reproducible documentation

## How to Build

1. Clone or download the repository
2. Compile `src/main.tex` using any LaTeX distribution such as TeXLive or Overleaf
3. Ensure the `figures` directory is included when compiling

The file `thesis.pdf` is provided for direct access to the final document.
